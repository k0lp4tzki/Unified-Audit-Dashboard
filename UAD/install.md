---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Apache Web Server
Install Apache if it's not already installed:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2


2. Install Oracle Instant Client

Follow the official guide to install the Oracle Instant Client: ðŸ‘‰ Oracle Instant Client Installation Guide

Make sure to update the system library cache:

sudo ldconfig /path/to/your/oracle/instantclient


sudo ldconfig /path/to/your/oracle/instantclient

Replace /path/to/your/oracle/instantclient with the actual install path.

3. Install PHP and Required Extensions

Install PHP with necessary extensions:

sudo apt install php php-oci8 php-ldap

Depending on your distribution, you may need to enable oci8 manually or specify the Oracle Home path in your php.ini.
4. Configure SSL (optional but recommended)

Enable SSL in Apache:

sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2ensite default-ssl

Edit your SSL VirtualHost (vhost-ssl.conf or default-ssl.conf) to point to your certificate files:

SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/your_certificate.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/your_private.key

Restart Apache:

sudo systemctl reload apache2

5. Adjust Apache Configuration

Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf or /etc/apache2/apache2.conf as needed:

    Ensure PHP is enabled

    Set correct DocumentRoot if you move the dashboard

    (Optional) Configure authentication methods (LDAP etc.)

Example to include PHP8 in Apache (if needed):

AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php

6. Deploy the Application

    Clone or download the dashboard code into your web server directory (/var/www/html/ or similar).

    Adjust your config.php to match your environment (database connection, credentials, etc.).

7. Oracle Connection Check

Verify that oci_connect() or new PDO('oci:...') successfully connects to your Oracle database from a simple PHP script.

If connection fails:

    Check LD_LIBRARY_PATH and ldconfig settings.

    Verify phpinfo() to confirm oci8 is loaded.


Notes

    For Oracle connections via oci8, it is essential that the Oracle Instant Client is correctly installed and ldconfig is updated.

    LDAP authentication is optional and requires the php-ldap module.

    SSL setup is strongly recommended for production environments.

Troubleshooting

    Blank Page: Check apache2/error.log for PHP errors.

    Database Connection Fails: Verify Oracle Instant Client path and permissions.

    SSL Issues: Make sure certificate files are correctly referenced and Apache has read access.
