# Unified Audit Dashboard

Welcome to the Unified Audit Dashboard!  
This project provides a clean, modern web interface to view and filter audit data from an Oracle database.

> **Note:**  
> This project was created with the help of GPT (AI-supported prompting and development).  
> Despite this assistance, completing it still took quite a bit of time ‚Äî because even AIs aren't perfect! üòâ  
> This dashboard is provided as a pure hobby project **without any warranty or official support**.  
> Suggestions, issues, and merge requests are very welcome, but please understand that I maintain this project in my free time.  
> Everyone is encouraged to adapt and modify the code to fit their own needs!
